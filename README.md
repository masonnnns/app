Welcome to Discordia

![Luvit <3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luvit/logo/master/logo-blue.png)

Luvit is an open-source, asynchronous I/O Lua runtime environment. It is a combination of LuaJIT and libuv, layered with various libraries to provide server-side functionality similar to that of Node.js, but with Lua instead of JavaScript. Luvit's companion package manager, lit, makes it easy to set up the Luvit runtime and its published libraries.

Discordia is a Lua wrapper for the official Discord API, and provides a high-level, object-oriented, event-driven interface for developing Discord bots. By using Lua's native coroutines, asynchronous HTTP and WebSocket communication is internally abstracted in a way that allows end-users to write blocking-style code without blocking I/O operations.
